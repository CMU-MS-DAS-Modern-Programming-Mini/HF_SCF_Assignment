    Here you will do the summation of the last two terms in the Fock matrix
    equation involving the two electron Integrals

    Hint: You can do this with explicit loops over matrix indices, whichwill
          have many for loops.

    This can also be done with numpy aggregations, bonus points if you
    implement this with only two loops.

    For example, the first term can be implemented like the following:
    (er_ints[mu,nu]*Duv).sum()
